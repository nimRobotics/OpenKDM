To solve the issue with freezed matplotlib 
pip3 install --upgrade 'setuptools<45.0.0'
also try specifying matplotlib backend at the top @   matplotlib.use("Qt5Agg")



You can for instance install it via the
following command:
    sudo dpkg -i target/OpenKDM.deb
This places it in /opt/OpenKDM. To uninstall it again, you can use:
    sudo dpkg --purge OpenKDM
